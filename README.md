# Football-WC2022-Prediction-Model
Used to predict the winner of the FIFA Men's World Cup 2022 using ML prediction model.

# Started this project as an end semester project of my AIML course. As a hardcore football fan i did not find any other better domain to start from.
# Have used all my basic knowledge of football to build a non-biased ML prediction model and logic to predict a winner in a match and as an end result the winner of the   World Cup itself.


Started off the project with the intention of creating a ML model can predict a winner in a non-biased way. Rather than just using previous history of world cup and other international matches to predict a winner, our team brainstormed enough to comeout with an idea of using the most crucial data , the players playing in each team. 

The final dataset is a collection of many smaller databanks including:
  1. Results of matches played by each international team for the past 48 years.
  2. Player stats of each team participating in the WC2022 therfore acquiring the the final Attacking , Defense , and Midfielder Stat of each team.
  3. Team overrall rating of the year.</br>
 Note: Used the help of FIFA Official data to conclude the dataset.
